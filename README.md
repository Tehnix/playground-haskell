# Haskell Playground
This repo contains small Haskell playgrounds, allowing me to quickly prototype and test out new libraries, ideas and concepts. Currently you can find:

- *freer-simple-fun* which is an exploration of using extensible effects, specifically via the [freer-simple](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/freer-simple) library
- *optics-fun* which is testing out the newly released [optics](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics) library, showcasing handling nested records
- *stm-fun* which is a small demonstration of using blocking on `TVar`s between a REPL and evaluation function
